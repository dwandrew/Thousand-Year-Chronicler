Hi Everyone, Good evening and Welcome to Thousand Year Chronicler!

This App is designed to work alongside the most wonderful game thousand year old vampire: 
https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/306279/Thousand-Year-Old-Vampire
The premise of which is a dice driven game of immortal survival as times change and you survive and thrive or fail and perish.

This app is built to provide you the framework to keep track of your resources as time goes on, and potentially share your tales with others when you are ready to.

To get hold of this app for the moment, feel free to fork and clone it,
you will need to go into the backend folder and run in the terminal:  db:create db:migrate.

Then jump on over to the frontend and run npm start form the terminal. Now you can go ahead and make your profile and start tracking your vampires!

I have every intention to host this online shortly, however I currently have a holiday booked so will do so when I return!
